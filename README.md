# Welcome to my Portfolio Site!

It's a work in progress, but I'm excited to share it with you!

Here's a link to the live site: https://www.stephenlyons.dev

## What's in the repo?

This repo contains the source code for my portfolio site. It's built with Create React App, and uses TypeScript as the main programming language.

## Who am I?

I'm a software engineer and student at the California State University, Long Beach. I'm currently working on my B.S. in Computer Science, and I'm expected to graduate in Spring 2023. I'm also a member of the CSULB Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter, and I'm the current Webmaster for the chapter.

## How do I interact with the site?

The site was built to have a clean and simple UI, but I am open to suggestions on how to improve it! I like using animations and transitions to make the site more interactive, so I'm always looking for new ways to make the site more engaging :)
