        pre-screen. You may be asked to show your green checkmark at any time

        <p>
            The University Library is a laid-back location with a lot to offer.
            Start on the first floor and grab a snack and drink at the Caffeine
            Lab, then make your way to one of the study floors. The basement is
            ideal for a relaxed groupwork session. The first floor has computers
            and printers available if you need them, and the second floor caters
            to a silent study hour. The third floor provides the opportunity to
            discuss topics from classes with fellow students, and the fourth
            floor is quiet, much like the second floor. Finally, the fifth floor
            has cubicles, long tables, and large whiteboards perfect for group
            studying.

            floors lined with colorful couches, wall-facing desks, and group
            study rooms. Make sure to research the facility online before you go
            to see which floor and study area will work best for you. Specific
            rooms will give different views of campus, varied seating options
            and study resources. Group study rooms usually have large
            whiteboards, communal desks, charging ports and couches. The SSC
            also houses the Bob Murphy Access Center, Equal Opportunity Program,
            Dream Success Center, Learning Assistance Center and more.

            for signs on the doors of these rooms to see when they are available
            for use. And if you get hungry while studying drop by the Beach
            Pantry in USU 116 for free food. The Pantry is open on weekdays and

            Robeks smoothie and get inspired by all the driven individuals in

            The USU also has a variety of outdoor study spaces to choose from.
            The second floor has seating areas in the Center Courtyard and the
            South Plaza. Each area has tables with blue umbrellas for students.

            eateries. The third floor has study spots on the Southeast and
            Southwest Terraces. Both have a selection of spread-out tables,
            black solar umbrellas and charging ports for devices. Take in the
            natural air, soak in the sun, and enjoy the view of students walking

        />
        <p>
            Maybe you want to study lying down. Grab a towel or picnic blanket
            and head over to the USU North Lawn and have a lowkey study session.
            Also, enjoy the ambiance of the Friendship Walk. Make yourself
            comfortable and absorb the white noise of passersby on the steps,
            cars driving by and the campus squirrels running to and from the
            trees. Another great lawn study spot is the grassy area between the
            Arts Buildings and Liberal Arts Buildings. Find a shady spot
            underneath a tree and get comfortable. Watch as students bike by, or
            faculty walk their dogs down the cement paths. On special occasions,
            you might catch a student organization advertising for an event, or
            a campus sponsor giving out free items to students.
